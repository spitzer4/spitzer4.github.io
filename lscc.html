		<p>A complete redesign of a community Chamber of Commerce website, transforming an outdated platform into a modern, user-centric information hub to better serve over 150 local businesses and thousands of residents.

			<p>
				The existing Logan Square Chamber of Commerce website suffered from two primary issues:            
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Aesthetics & Credibility: </strong>The site felt visually outdated and cluttered, undermining the Chamber's professional image and vital role in the community.</li>
				<li><strong>Information Architecture: </strong>Key community information, especially details about the widely popular Farmers Market, was buried, making it difficult for visitors and tourists to find essential details like operating hours, vendor lists, and location.</li>

				A Modern, Mobile-First Design Focused on Accessibility
			</h2>
		</div>
        <div class="lg:col-span-2 space-y-8 text-lg text-gray-700">
			<p>
				I designed a responsive, modern website that prioritized two main goals: a refreshed aesthetic and clear, concise navigation. The core of the solution was creating a dedicated, information-rich, and easy-to-navigate section for the Farmers Market.
			</p>
			<!-- FM Home page -->
			<p>Features high-impact photography and immediately surfaces key details (dates, times, location) to solve the "hidden information" problem.</p>
			<!-- Mobile home page -->
			<p>Focuses on responsiveness, ensuring core calls-to-action and primary navigation are immediately accessible on a small screen to address the mobile-unfriendly nature of the old site.</p>
			Main nav/header
			<p>Cleans up the navigation to a streamlined list, making it easier for users to jump to sections like "Farmers Market," "Membership," and "Community Events."</p>

				Understanding the User and the Landscape
			</h2>
		</div>
        <div class="lg:col-span-2 space-y-8 text-lg text-gray-700">
			<p>Initial research goals included user interviews and testing, but stakeholder alignment challenges prevented these methods. To ensure the redesign was still based on proven user behavior and clear best practices, we prioritized a comprehensive Competitive and Comparative Analysis (CCA). This analysis served as the essential evidence base for validating the project's core hypothesis.</p>

        <div class="lg:col-span-2 space-y-8 text-lg text-gray-700">

				<strong>Main Insight: </strong>Successful Chamber websites prioritize large, clean photography and a simple, task-oriented navigation. They treat their Farmers Market as a primary product, giving it high visibility. This confirmed the need to give the market its own clear, top-level navigation link.

			<quote><strong>Main Insight: </strong>The existing Logan Square Chamber site's issues (clutter and buried information) were not unique user preferences, but a violation of established digital best practices within the Chamber and tourism sectors.

				Navigating Stakeholder Vision and Technical Limitations
			</h2>
		</div>
        <div class="lg:col-span-2 space-y-8 text-lg text-gray-700">
			<p>This project's real challenge was balancing an ideal user experience with real-world constraints.</p>
			<p><strong>Stakeholder Constraints: </strong>Refining Content & Visuals</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The initial structure of the Farmers Market page had to be adapted to prominently showcase specific videos and images requested by the Chamber, leading to a shift in the content hierarchy.</li>
				<li>The Awards section for the Market was updated to be anti-chronological, ensuring the most relevant and recent achievements are immediately visible to users.</li>
				<li>A new, mandatory SSA Website nav link was required, slightly altering the primary navigation flow.</li>
				<li>Due to the stakeholders' chosen logo already containing the full text "Logan Square Chamber of Commerce," the redundant text label in the header was removed, streamlining the masthead.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Wix Constraints: </strong>The Reality of Platform Design</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Header and Footer formatting in Wix was inflexible, forcing a simpler design than the original mockup. This limited sophisticated alignment and spacing, resulting in a cleaner, but less custom, look.</li>
				<li>The display of Member and Community Events was largely dictated by Wix's default event layout, preventing the detailed custom layouts planned in Figma.</li>
				<li>Difficulties maintaining consistent, pixel-perfect spacing and alignment in the Wix editor led to the strategic removal of decorative elements to ensure a cleaner, more stable, and professional appearance across all devices.</li>

				Delivering Solutions Under Constraint
			</h2>

			<p>
				This project provided a valuable lesson in translating stakeholder intent and business goals into a functional product under technical constraints. While the final design differs from the initial, ideal mockups, the deployed website is significantly more modern, accessible, and user-friendly, successfully meeting the core user and client goals.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Measurable Impact & Qualitative Wins</strong></li>
				<p>The redesign directly solved the two primary user pain points identified in our initial research: hidden information and low credibility.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Improved Information Architecture: </strong>The creation of a dedicated, top-level navigation link for the Farmers Market immediately solved the "hidden information" problem.</li>
					<li><strong>Enhanced Credibility and Aesthetics: </strong>The new, responsive framework and high-impact photography directly improved the Chamber's professional image. Stakeholder feedback confirmed the site now "feels credible" and is aligned with the vibrancy of the Logan Square community.</li>
					<li><strong>Successful Constraint Management: </strong>The deployed design met all core user needs despite adhering to the client-mandated Wix platform and navigating late-stage content revisions, demonstrating the ability to deliver impactful UX solutions under strict technical and organizational pressure.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><strong>Learnings & Future Strategy</strong></li>
				<p>This project reinforced the necessity of adapting an ideal UX vision to real-world limitations and taught critical lessons on project evolution.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Learning 1: Prioritize Content Over Pixel-Perfection. </strong>
The inflexibility of the Wix editor meant sacrificing detailed custom layouts and pixel-perfect spacing. The learning was that effective UX, in this context, was about delivering a cleaner, stable appearance across all devices and ensuring content clarity, not about replicating an ideal Figma mockup.</li>
					<li><strong>Learning 2: Proactive Constraint Mapping. </strong>
If I were to start this project again, I would perform a deeper technical audit of the chosen platform (Wix) before high-fidelity design to manage client expectations earlier and reduce late-stage compromise</li>
					<li><strong>Next Steps: Addressing the Traffic Dip. </strong>
Initial analytics show a temporary dip in overall organic traffic following the launch - a common side-effect of significant Information Architecture changes. The immediate next phase is to partner with a content strategist to implement targeted SEO keyword optimization across key pages to restore and exceed previous organic search volume. Long-term success will be tracked via A/B testing on membership conversion pages.</li>
